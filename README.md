# OctoShelf

Ever find yourself tabbing between multiple repos across several orgs,
trying to manage the constant flow of new pull requests?

Cool, me too! OctoShelf was built to solve this exact issue!

## Usage

To use OctoShelf you can either go here ( TODO: PUSH GH-PAGES AND UPDATE ME :) ),
or you can fork and hack this project to meet your own use cases.

* All the github api calls are done on the client side.
* A history of the repositories you added will live on your browser session (with localStorage).

## Contributing

I welcome any and all forms of contributions. If you have a feature request, feel
free to open a new issue, or better yet, open a new pull request yourself! :)
